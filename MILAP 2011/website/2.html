    <p>The cuisine of Punjab has an enormous variety of mouth watering vegetarian as well as non vegetarian dishes. Punjabi food is relished by people of all communities. Wheat is the staple food of Punjabis; however, they do enjoy eating rice on festivities and other special occasions. They are real lively people who are extremely fond of eating good food. In the preparation of Punjabi food, onion, ginger and garlic are used extensively to enhance the taste of food. Robust and rich are adjectives that go well with Punjabi cuisine. A litre of milk in the morning, a dozen butter`ful' rotis with paneer and aloo dishes for lunch followed by a huge glass of lassi, apart from an invigorating cup of masala chai is what one is reminded of while speaking of Punjabi food.

<p><strong>Food that could be stored for several days and could be consumed without heating was preferred. Shortage of water, fresh green vegetables had effected the formula of cooking in Rajasthan. In the desert belt of Jaisalmer, Barmer and Bikaner, the meals are made with the use of milk, buttermilk and clarified butter or minimum water instead of water used in most of the Indian cooking.

Food is usually cooked over a wood or charcoal fire in the remote areas but the people of the urban area use LPGs, Hot Plates, Microwaves, Heater, etc. for cooking. The utensils of clay, brass or copper are generally used. </p>
