    </font><br></p>
    <p>Kashmiri cuisine  has evolved over hundreds of years. The first major influence was the food of the Kashmiri Pandits, the Hindus of the valley. The cuisine was then influenced by the cultures which arrived with the invasion of Kashmir by the Timur from the region of modern Uzbekistan. Subsequently, Kashmir and its food has been strongly influenced by the cuisines of Central Asia, Persia, Middle East and Afghanistan.

The most notable ingredient in Kashmir cuisine is mutton, of which there are over 30 varieties. Also to be noted are Balti curries, popular in the United Kingdom for their exotic tastes, that have spread from the Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir. </p>

<p><strong>Kerala cuisine is quite diverse. The diversity is best classified on   the basis of the various communities. The Hindus, especially the   Namboodris and Nairs have a predominantly vegetarian cuisine, whilst the   Christian and the Muslim communities have a largely non-vegetarian   cuisine. The Syrian Christian dishes and Malabari Muslim dishes are   famous. Since Kerala's main export is coconuts, almost all of the   dishes, irrespective of the variety in the cuisines of the different   communities, have coconuts associated with them, either in the form of   shavings or oil extracted from the nut. Seafood is also very popular in   the coastal regions and eaten almost every day..</strong></p>
