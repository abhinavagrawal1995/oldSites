    <p><b><font size="4">Indian cuisine is characterized by the extensive use of various spices, herbs, vegetables, and  fruits grown in India. Each family of   Indian cuisine includes a wide assortment of dishes and cooking techniques. As a   consequence, it varies from region to region, reflecting the varied   demographics of the ethnically-diverse subcontinent. Indian cuisine is so wide, so extensive that it is impossible to know all about it at once. But at Bhookars.com you can find all the information that you want or need to know about this amazing cuisine! Be it famous dishes, recipes,  places to eat at or our ratings on them- you will find it all here, under one roof- only @ Bhookars.com!</font></p>
