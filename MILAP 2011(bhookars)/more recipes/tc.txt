Prep Time: 8 hours, 45 minutes
Cook Time: 45 minutes
Total Time: 9 hours, 30 minutes
Ingredients:

    * 1 (3-pound) chicken, cut into serving pieces, skinned and trimmed of all visible fat
    * 1/2 cup plain yogurt
    * 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice or malt vinegar
    * 1 tablespoon minced garlic
    * 1 tablespoon peeled and grated or crushed ginger root
    * 1 tablespoon ground cumin
    * 1 teaspoon ground coriander
    * 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
    * 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
    * 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
    * 1/4 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper
    * 2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
    * Vegetable oil, for brushing
    * Fresh cilantro sprigs for garnish
    * Slices of cucumber, red (Spanish) onion, tomato and lemon, for garnish

Preparation:
Prick the flesh of the chicken all over with a fork. Then, using a sharp knife, cut slashes in the flesh to allow the marinade to penetrate. Place the chicken in a nonreactive large, shallow dish.

In a nonreactive bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice or vinegar, garlic, ginger, cumin, ground coriander, cayenne pepper, cardamom, cloves, black pepper and salt. Stir until well-mixed, then pour the mixture over the chicken and rub it into the flesh, turning the chicken several times. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours or overnight. (Do not marinate for longer than 2 days.) Remove the chicken from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before cooking.

The chicken may be grilled or roasted. If using a charcoal grill, prepare a fire for direct-heat cooking. Position the grill rack 5 inches from the fire. Allow the coals to burn until white ash covers them and the heat is moderate.

Remove the chicken from the marinade, pressing lightly to extract excess marinade, and brush with oil. Place the chicken pieces on a well-oiled grill rack and; grill, covered, with the vents open, turning 3 or 4 times, 45 minutes or until the juices run clear when a piece is pierced near the bone with a knife.

If roasting, preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place the chicken on a rack in a roasting pan, brush with oil, and cook, turning once, 25 to 30 minutes until the juices run clear when a piece is pierced near the bone with a knife.

Serve with sprigs of cilantro and slices of cucumber, red onion, tomato, and lemon.
