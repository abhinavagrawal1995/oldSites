		   <font color="#FFFFFF"><ul type="square"><li><u>14 August 2011</u> - In a scathing attack on Anna Hazare, Congress spokesperson, Manish Tewari, and an MP from Ludhiana constituency, described Anna Hazare as being "involved in corruption from top to bottom", "neck deep in corruption”, and also mentioning that the social activist needed to be “shown his place”.</li>
		   <li><u>15 August 2011</u> - Anna Hazare announced at a press conference that he and his supporters were determined to go ahead with the fast on 16 August 2011 as planned. He also urged people to court arrest to push for a stronger Lokpal bill.
Section 144 was imposed a night before the planned protest date, at JP Park, Rajghat and Dilli Gate, which prohibited assembly of five or more persons</li>
		   <li><u>16 August 2011</u> - Anna Hazare was detained by Delhi Police in the early morning before he could start his hunger strike at JP park, Delhi. Delhi Police had asked Anna not to leave his home, which he declined, and Anna was detained at his residence in Mayur Vihar. Arvind Kejriwal, Kiran Bedi, Manish Sisodia and more than 1200 supporters were also taken into preventive custody by the Police.
Anna Hazare was sent to seven days judicial custody to Tihar jail after refusing to sign a personal bond to be released on bail.
Shehla Masood, an RTI activist and a strong supporter of Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement, was shot dead around 11.30am IST. An unidentified assailant shot her in front of her house in Koh-e-Fiza, Bhopal.
Kiran Bedi and Shanti Bhushan, detained by Delhi Police on the morning ahead of Anna Hazare's fast-unto-death, were released in the evening at around 6:30pm IST.
The current telecom minister Kapil Sibal was greeted with black flags and booed by a group of students at a seminar on the Jan Lokpal bill.
With the Government of India, preparing to release Anna Hazare late in the night, however Anna refused to come out of Tihar jail until the government agreed to an unconditional permission to hold protests at JP Park.
Demonstrations were held all over India protesting Anna Hazare's arrest. In Chennai, Mahatma Gandhi's secretary, V Kalyanam led the protestors. He said - "India will get a sure gold medal if corruption is entered as an item in the Olympic Games. We may not be a force in football or athletics or hockey. But India is the undisputed global leader in corruption.” Referring to Anna Hazare’s arrest in New Delhi, Kalyanam said it was easier to fight foreign tyranny than the tyranny of our own people. He ridiculed the contention of Union ministers like Kapil Sibal and Chidambaram that Parliament was supreme and civil society had no voice.</li>
		   <li><u>17 August 2011</u> - After almost a day, Anna still refused to leave jail and spent the night in a room in Tihar jail, despite the government decision to free him.
Delhi Police made concessions for Anna Hazare to fast, stepping up from seven days to 14 days and finally 21 days at Ramlila Maidan.
Congress made a statement that they suspected a foreign hand in the protests and asked the government to probe if the US was behind Anna's agitation .</li>
		   <li><u>18 August 2011</u> - Anna Hazare agreed to leave jail after Delhi Police granted him permission to fast for 15-days against corruption at Ramlila Maidan. However, he would spend another night in Jail till the venue is ready.
Arvind Kejriwal left Tihar jail being there for two days. Kejriwal called this move as just the beginning of their fight against corruption, and also confirmed that Anna Hazare would leave the jail once the grounds at Ramlila Maidan are ready for the fast.</li>
		   <li><u>19 August 2011</u> - Anna Hazare left Tihar Jail at 15 minutes to noon IST after 3 days, to a spontaneous roar of welcome from the huge crowd assembled near the Jail. Just past the gates, he raised his hand in the air and shouted "Bharat mata ki Jai (Victory to Mother India)". He also addressed the public stating: "Whether I am there or not, this fight will continue." which too received a huge roar of applause. Anna waved the national flag towards the crowd, who responded by waving hundreds of smaller flags and chanted "Anna zindabad (long live Anna)".
Paying obeisance to Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat and Amar Jawan Jyoti at the India Gate, Anna Hazare reached Delhi's Ramlila Maidan to launch a 15-day mass protest against corruption.
Anna Hazare finally launched his protest at Ramlila Maidan as he declared that he will not quit the venue till the Jan Lokpal Bill is passed.
Varun Gandhi, Bharatiya Janata Party MP announced that he will introduce Anna Hazare's Jan Lokpal Bill in the Lok Sabha as a private member's bill, saying that Jan Lokpal Bill is better than anything the nation has seen before and would like to make a small contribution in his own way.</li>
