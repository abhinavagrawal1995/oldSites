----------
We had initiall constructed a gallery using flash with all kinds of mouseover and zooming and revolving scripts.
However due to our carelesness, the pen drive it was stored in somehow got corrupted. since we had no backup and the
deadline for submission was two days away, we could not recreate it.

we made a new simple gallery and managed to submit it by the deadline.
