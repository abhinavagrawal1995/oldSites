		     <li> <u>4 April 2011</u> -   Anna Hazare announced that he would commence his &quot;fast unto death&quot; and that this would last until a comprehensive measure to tackle corruption was introduced. He claimed that the government had excluded &quot;civil society&quot; from the panel set up to draft the Jan Lokpal Bill, and implied that at least one of the people who was to be on the drafting committee - Sharad Pawar - might be unsuitable for that role because of his large landholdings. Kiran Bedi and Swami Agnivesh voiced their support for Hazare. Later a video exposed Agnivesh talking to Kapil sibal and saying, this is happening like mad. The more concessions are given, the more these people are trying to climb over the head and that no more concession to be given and the movement need to be stopped. </li>
			 
			 <li><u>5 April 2011</u> - Hazare initiated his fast at Jantar Mantar in Delhi. Elsewhere, people attended a protest at Freedom Park, Bangalore.
Campaigners for India Against Corruption (IAC) estimated that a petition circulated in the city of Pune which demanded that the government enact a bill had attracted between 5000 and 6000 signatures between 3 April and 5 April. Hazare has been involved with IAC, a group established by various prominent activists with the primary purpose of achieving the legal enactment and subsequent enforcement of a strong version of the Jan Lokpal bill.</li>
			 <li><u>7 April 2011</u> - Two rounds of talks failed. There was agreement regarding constituting a panel to examine the Bill but the government would not accede to demands that it should be a formally constituted panel or that Hazare should lead it. As a consequence of this, Hazare continued his fast.
			 Narendra Modi, the chief Minister of Gujarat lashes out at Manmohan Singh for resisting the passage of the Jan Lokpal Bill.
			 Sonia Gandhi the president of the Indian National Congress party and the head of the National Advisory Councilappealed to Hazare to end his indefinite fast.
			Hazare and the protesters tried to keep the protests non-political. No politicians were welcome at the site of the fast. Former Haryana Chief MinisterOm Prakash Chautala, former Madhya PradeshChief Minister Uma Bharti and journalist Barkha Dutt were forced by civilians to leave, after the protesters objected to their presence, which they believed was harming the integrity of their movement.</li>
			 <li><u>8 April 2011</u> - Protests spread to numerous other places, including Mumbai, Kolkata, Thiruvananthapuram, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Chennai, Patna, Bhopal, Ahmedabad, Ranchi, Pune, and the University of Jammu.
The government continued to squabble with the activists stating that the bill drafting committee will be headed by a government appointed minister and not a civil society member as the protesters demanded to avoid allowing the government to make the bill less powerful.
The Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, met with the President of India to outline to her how the government was going ahead with the demands of the population.
15 supporters of Hazare on fast were hospitalized.
Bollywood came out in support of the protests, with actors, musicians and directors speaking in support of the movement and Hazare. Director Farah Khan, actor Anupam Kher, music director Vishal Dadlani, poet-filmmaker Pritish Nandy and actor Tom Alter all visited Jantar Mantar; others stated their support for the movement via social networking websites or the media. Oscar winning Indian composer A. R. Rahman also declared his support for the anti-graft movement.
Renowned Indian/Qatari artist Late M. F. Hussain showed his support by drawing a cartoon of Hazare.
Indian students at Cambridge University, the former alma mater of the Indian Prime Minister also expressed their support for the movement.
Many prominent people from government agencies as well as from various corporate houses came out in support of the movement. Some of them were - Delhi Metro chief E. Sreedharan. (also called the Metro Man of India), Punj Lloyd chairman Atul Punj, Maruti Suzuki chairman R. C. Bhargava, Hero group's Sunil Munjal, Tata Steel vice-chairman B Muthuraman, Bajaj Auto Chairman Rahul Bajaj, Godrej Group head Adi Godrej, Biocon Chairman and Managing Director Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and Kotak Mahindra Bank vice-chairman & managing director Uday Kotak. They all declared their support for Hazare and the movement.
ASSOCHAM President Dilip Modi and FICCI Director General Rajiv Kumar, too came out in support of the movement.
The Government of India accepted the compromise formula that there be a politician chairman and an activist non-politician Co-Chairman. It was reported that Pranab Mukherjee will be the Chairman of the draft committee while Shanti Bhushan will be the co-chairman.Bhushan was one of the original drafters of the Lokpal Bill along with Hazare, Justice N. Santosh Hegde, advocate Prashant Bhushan, and RTI activist Arvind Kejriwal.</li>
